# CFB Engine — Market Diagnostic Preflight v1.144

Status: SOURCE/SEMANTIC RECOVERY REQUIRED BEFORE MARKET JOIN
Parent: v1.143 prospective post-validation contract

## Recovered authoritative boundary
Curated dependency authority says:
- current market consensus/benchmark prices require fresh web/market retrieval and timestamps;
- execution sportsbook prices are separate from the benchmark layer and are authoritative for an actual wager only when Adam provides/confirms them;
- a previously frozen fair line may remain a model artifact, but no actionable bet is valid without a current qualified comparison price.

Repository search at the current frontier does not expose a frozen historical market-source/timestamp/vig/game-mapping contract suitable for retrospective 2023–2024 Challenger-A diagnostics.

## Classification
Do NOT fetch a convenient historical odds dataset and silently declare it equivalent. Historical market diagnostics are BLOCKED at source-semantic qualification, not at model execution.

A valid historical diagnostic source must prospectively establish, before result inspection:
1. provider/source and provenance;
2. coverage population and missingness;
3. exact timestamp semantics (opening/closing/snapshot);
4. spread/total home-away sign conventions;
5. moneyline/odds representation and vig-removal method where applicable;
6. game identity and neutral-site mapping;
7. handling of pushes, pick'em, stale/conflicting books and line moves;
8. whether source values were actually available at the represented time;
9. immutable fair-prediction join key so market data cannot feed back into Challenger A.

Until recovered or newly qualified, historical market-relative evaluation remains OPEN.

## Dependency consequence
Because market diagnostics are source-blocked, the highest-value safe branch is 2025 holdout PREPARATION ONLY:
- recover/generate predictor inputs using the already frozen Challenger-A rules;
- do not read/join 2025 outcomes into model evaluation;
- freeze exact 2025 prediction population and fair predictions before any outcome scoring;
- independently audit leakage and candidate identity;
- require a separate explicit checkpoint/authorization before scoring 2025 outcomes.

This preflight does not itself authorize 2025 scoring.

Locks unchanged: production v1 champion; Challenger A shadow; no market join; no TEST scoring; no promotion.
