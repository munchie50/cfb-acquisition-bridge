# CFB Postgame FIRST_FROZEN Scorecard

Status: ACTIVE APPEND-ONLY DERIVED EVALUATION SURFACE
Initialized: 2026-09-27

## Purpose
Canonical governed scorecard joining immutable FIRST_FROZEN Champion predictions to independently sourced final results after games are final.

## Required fields
- game identity
- FIRST_FROZEN prediction artifact/reference and freeze timestamp
- projected margin/total/win probability as frozen
- final score/result source and retrieval timestamp
- realized margin/total/winner
- signed/absolute margin error and total error where computable
- win-probability outcome pairing without retroactive recalibration
- exclusion/unresolved status
- scoring-run receipt/reference

## Chronology locks
Results may be joined only after the corresponding prediction was genuinely frozen pre-event. Outcome knowledge never creates, edits, or fills a missing prediction. Ambiguous game/result joins remain UNRESOLVED.

## Initial state
This file defines the durable surface. Historical 2026 scoring is populated only by a governed scoring run from the accepted frozen prediction artifact plus authoritative final results; it is not reconstructed from memory.

## Write-path validation — 2026-09-27 13:03 CT
- Purpose: controlled repair validation for canonical existing-file mutation.
- Governance effect: none; no decision, execution, settlement, prediction, score, or outcome state created.
- Method: SHA-guarded existing-file update followed by direct repository readback.
